/**
	Node.js uses a `KeyObject` class to represent a symmetric or asymmetric key,
	and each kind of key exposes different functions. The {@link createSecretKey}, {@link createPublicKey} and {@link createPrivateKey} methods are used to create `KeyObject`instances. `KeyObject`
	objects are not to be created directly using the `new`keyword.
	
	Most applications should consider using the new `KeyObject` API instead of
	passing keys as strings or `Buffer`s due to improved security features.
	
	`KeyObject` instances can be passed to other threads via `postMessage()`.
	The receiver obtains a cloned `KeyObject`, and the `KeyObject` does not need to
	be listed in the `transferList` argument.

		result is a string, when DER it will be a buffer containing the data
		encoded as DER, when [JWK](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) it will be an object.
		
		When [JWK](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) encoding format was selected, all other encoding options are

		PKCS#1, SEC1, and PKCS#8 type keys can be encrypted by using a combination of
		the `cipher` and `format` options. The PKCS#8 `type` can be used with any`format` to encrypt any key algorithm (RSA, EC, or DH) by specifying a`cipher`. PKCS#1 and SEC1 can only be
		encrypted by specifying a `cipher`when the PEM `format` is used. For maximum compatibility, use PKCS#8 for
		encrypted private keys. Since PKCS#8 defines its own
		encryption mechanism, PEM-level encryption is not supported when encrypting
		a PKCS#8 key. See [RFC 5208](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5208.txt) for PKCS#8 encryption and [RFC 1421](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1421.txt) for
