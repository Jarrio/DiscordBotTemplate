		For UDP sockets, causes the `dgram.Socket` to listen for datagram

		random port. If `address` is not specified, the operating system will
		attempt to listen on all addresses. Once binding is complete, a`'listening'` event is emitted and the optional `callback` function is
		called.
		
		Specifying both a `'listening'` event listener and passing a`callback` to the `socket.bind()` method is not harmful but not very
		useful.
		
		A bound datagram socket keeps the Node.js process running to receive
		datagram messages.
		
		If binding fails, an `'error'` event is generated. In rare case (e.g.
		attempting to bind with a closed socket), an `Error` may be thrown.
		
		Example of a UDP server listening on port 41234:
		
		```js
		import dgram from 'dgram';
		
		const server = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
		
		server.on('error', (err) => {

		server.on('listening', () => {
		   const address = server.address();
		   console.log(`server listening ${address.address}:${address.port}`);

		Broadcasts a datagram on the socket.
		For connectionless sockets, the destination `port` and `address` must be
		specified. Connected sockets, on the other hand, will use their associated
		remote endpoint, so the `port` and `address` arguments must not be set.
		
		The `msg` argument contains the message to be sent.
		Depending on its type, different behavior can apply. If `msg` is a `Buffer`,
		any `TypedArray` or a `DataView`,
		the `offset` and `length` specify the offset within the `Buffer` where the
		message begins and the number of bytes in the message, respectively.
		If `msg` is a `String`, then it is automatically converted to a `Buffer`with `'utf8'` encoding. With messages that
		contain multi-byte characters, `offset` and `length` will be calculated with
		respect to `byte length` and not the character position.
		If `msg` is an array, `offset` and `length` must not be specified.
		
		The `address` argument is a string. If the value of `address` is a host name,
		DNS will be used to resolve the address of the host. If `address` is not
		provided or otherwise falsy, `'127.0.0.1'` (for `udp4` sockets) or `'::1'`(for `udp6` sockets) will be used by default.
		
		If the socket has not been previously bound with a call to `bind`, the socket
		is assigned a random port number and is bound to the "all interfaces" address
		(`'0.0.0.0'` for `udp4` sockets, `'::0'` for `udp6` sockets.)
		
		An optional `callback` function may be specified to as a way of reporting
		DNS errors or for determining when it is safe to reuse the `buf` object.
		DNS lookups delay the time to send for at least one tick of the
		Node.js event loop.
		
		The only way to know for sure that the datagram has been sent is by using a`callback`. If an error occurs and a `callback` is given, the error will be
		passed as the first argument to the `callback`. If a `callback` is not given,
		the error is emitted as an `'error'` event on the `socket` object.
		
		Offset and length are optional but both _must_ be set if either are used.
		They are supported only when the first argument is a `Buffer`, a `TypedArray`,
		or a `DataView`.
		
		This method throws `ERR_SOCKET_BAD_PORT` if called on an unbound socket.
		
		Example of sending a UDP packet to a port on `localhost`;
		
		```js
		import dgram from 'dgram';
		import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
		
		const message = Buffer.from('Some bytes');
		const client = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
		client.send(message, 41234, 'localhost', (err) => {
		   client.close();
		});
		```
		
		Example of sending a UDP packet composed of multiple buffers to a port on`127.0.0.1`;
		
		```js
		import dgram from 'dgram';
		import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
		
		const buf1 = Buffer.from('Some ');
		const buf2 = Buffer.from('bytes');
		const client = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
		client.send([buf1, buf2], 41234, (err) => {
		   client.close();
		});
		```
		
		Sending multiple buffers might be faster or slower depending on the
		application and operating system. Run benchmarks to
		determine the optimal strategy on a case-by-case basis. Generally speaking,
		however, sending multiple buffers is faster.
		
		Example of sending a UDP packet using a socket connected to a port on`localhost`:
		
		```js
		import dgram from 'dgram';
		import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
		
		const message = Buffer.from('Some bytes');
		const client = dgram.createSocket('udp4');
		client.connect(41234, 'localhost', (err) => {
		   client.send(message, (err) => {
		     client.close();
		   });
		});

		Sets the default outgoing multicast interface of the socket to a chosen

		For IPv4 sockets, this should be the IP configured for the desired physical

		For IPv6 sockets, `multicastInterface` should include a scope to indicate the

		```js
		const callback = (stream) => {
		   console.log('someone connected!');
		};
		server.on('connection', callback);
		// ...
		server.removeListener('connection', callback);
		```
		
		`removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the
		listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the
		listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be
		called multiple times to remove each instance.
		
		Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the
		time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any`removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls _after_ emitting and_before_ the last listener finishes execution will
		not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.
		
		```js
		const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
		
		const callbackA = () => {
		   console.log('A');
		   myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
		};
		
		const callbackB = () => {
		   console.log('B');
		};
		
		myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);
		
		myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);
		
		// callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
		// Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
		myEmitter.emit('event');
		// Prints:
		//   A
		//   B
		
		// callbackB is now removed.
		// Internal listener array [callbackA]
		myEmitter.emit('event');
		// Prints:
		//   A
		```
		
		Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will
		change the position indices of any listener registered _after_ the listener
		being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called,
		but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by
		the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.
		
		When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single
		event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most
		recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')`listener is removed:
		
		```js
		const ee = new EventEmitter();
		
		function pong() {
		   console.log('pong');
		}
		
		ee.on('ping', pong);
		ee.once('ping', pong);
		ee.removeListener('ping', pong);
		
		ee.emit('ping');
		ee.emit('ping');
		```
