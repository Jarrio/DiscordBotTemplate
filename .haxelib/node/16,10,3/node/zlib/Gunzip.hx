		The `readable.read()` method pulls some data out of the internal buffer and

		the data will be returned as a `Buffer` object unless an encoding has been
		specified using the `readable.setEncoding()` method or the stream is operating
		in object mode.
		
		The optional `size` argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If`size` bytes are not available to be read, `null` will be returned _unless_the stream has ended, in which
		case all of the data remaining in the internal
		buffer will be returned.
		
		If the `size` argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the
		internal buffer will be returned.
		
		The `size` argument must be less than or equal to 1 GiB.
		
		The `readable.read()` method should only be called on `Readable` streams
		operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called
		automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.
		
		```js
		const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
		
		// 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
		readable.on('readable', () => {
		   let chunk;
		   console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');
		   // Use a loop to make sure we read all currently available data
		   while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
		     console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data...`);
		   }
		});
		
		// 'end' will be triggered once when there is no more data available
		readable.on('end', () => {
		   console.log('Reached end of stream.');
		});
		```
		
		Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks
		are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data
		currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`,
		having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to
		come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted
		when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be
		emitted when there is no more data to come.
		
		Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary
		to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:
		
		```js
		const chunks = [];
		
		readable.on('readable', () => {
		   let chunk;
		   while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
		     chunks.push(chunk);
		   }
		});
		
		readable.on('end', () => {
		   const content = chunks.join('');
		});
		```
		
		A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from
		a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the`size` argument.
		
		If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will
		also be emitted.
		
		Calling {@link read} after the `'end'` event has
		been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.

		`removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the
		listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the
		listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be
		called multiple times to remove each instance.
		
		Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the

		not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

		// callbackB is now removed.

		Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will
